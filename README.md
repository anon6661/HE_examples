# Visualization examples
Visualization examples for hierarchical explanations of HE_loo and HE_lime on SST-2 and MNLI datasets.

# Implementation
The implementation of HE_loo and HE_lime.

#
Requirement
The implementations are based on the Huggingfaceâ€™s transformer model (\url{https://github.com/huggingface/transformers}) and the official code repository of LIME (\url{https://github.com/marcotcr/lime}).

Among them, the lime-text.py and line_base of lime in the LIME library have been rewritten. After installing lime, they need to be replaced with the rewritten files.
